This lists and describes the FPGA projects which are stored in subdirectories.

register        A project to test the FMC interface. It emulates a four-word static RAM. It is entirely asynchronous.
                It includes a debugger that runs off a 200 MHz clock generated by the PLL.


qbus            A similar project to test the Qbus interface. It includes the FMC project.
                After using Verilog off and on over the past 35 years, I started learning SystemVerilog with this project.
