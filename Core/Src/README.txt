Bear Metal Shell
A small embedded command line processor.

Bear Metal Threads
Extremely minimal non-preemptive thread switching for bare metal.


The original version of this code was developed in 2009 for a home
project that was intended to result in a digital controller for my
trolling motor that had a burned out speed control switch. The
controller was a Luminary Micro Cortex-M3 eval board. The motor driver
was made for RC model planes. It worked fine on dry land, but when I got
it into the water it went poof after about a minute and the magic smoke
came out. Evidently the motor's resistance and current were compatible
with the RC drive circuit, but the inductance of the trolling motor was
a lot more than an airplane motor. Under load, the inductive kick took
out the catch diodes.

The motor controller wound up in the scrap pile, I got a new mechnical
switch for the boat motor and gave it away, but the firmware lives on,
and on, and on. It found many uses, including some products of my
employer. The files here are derived from the original code I wrote for
the Luminary Micro Cortex-M3, or are newly written since I retired.
